# Project Proposal
Team: Yuhaniz, Morgan, Dainese, and Karen

## Introduction
The purpose of our project is to investigate the racial inequalities and inequities  around police violence in the United States. We will observe many different demographic characteristics, such as race, gender, age, year, and location. We will also observe the cause of death of victims and look for patterns and relationships associated with race specifically.

Our target audience is the general public who are interested in learning facts about police violence in the U.S. Given our current political state and the #BlackLivesMatter movement, we think our research will benefit those who are looking for quantitative data around police brutality. People will learn about the number of people who were killed by police, the cities with the most police violence, and the frequency of shootings. Our visualizations will allow people to think critically about police injustices in the U.S.

The overarching question framing our project is **what inequities can be revealed in police brutality and its repercussions in the U.S.?** Some of our key questions are as follows:

 * Out of all the citizens killed by the police from 2018 to 2020, which victims were armed with dangerous weapons? _*Note for us: Found in shootings_wash_post.csv_

 * What cities experienced the most police violence from 2013 to 2020 and what possible reasons (racial, socioeconomic, political) could contribute to this statistic?

 * Which period of time in a year do most shootings by police occur?

## Previous Literature

 * The article, [_Racial Inequity in Fatal US Police Shootings, 2015-2020_](https://jech.bmj.com/content/75/4/394.abstract), discusses a longitudinal study of Washington Post data on officer-involved shooting fatalities in the U.S. This study found that violent police encounters account for high mortality rates in the U.S. More specifically, BIPOC are disproportionately impacted, making police shootings a public health emergency.

 * The article, [_The Prevalence of Fatal Police Shootings by U.S. Police, 2015-2016: Patterns and Answers From a New Data Set_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235217301344), compares national fatal police shooting incidence data to U.S fatal police shootings. The findings suggest fatalities are stable across the years nationally. However, data does show that Black people are fatally shot at higher rates in the U.S.

 * The article, [_Police Violence, Use of Force Policies, and Public Health_](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Paper-Obasogie.pdf), takes note that police brutality has different implications and health impacts for different communities. Communities of color experience higher rates of harmful health outcomes and killings as a result of flawed use of police force. Changing police force policies is an important step in decreasing violence and death -- both public health issues. 

## Our Datasets

 * The dataset [“Police Violence and Racial Equity”](https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/police-violence-in-the-us) was accessed on Kaggle. The data was created and posted by John Miller, who is a senior data analyst at H2O.ai. However the information on the dataset is pulled from several different sources including the [Mapping Police Violence database](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/aboutthedata) and the [Fatal Encounters database](https://fatalencounters.org/). This dataset was created in hopes of raising awareness about the number of people who have been victims of police brutality. More specifically, this dataset specifically contains more information about the people killed in order to recognize the names of those who’ve died in the hands of police.

 * The dataset [“Police Violence and Racial Equity Part 2 of 3”](https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/police-violence-racial-equity) was also accessed on Kaggle and collected by John Miller. This dataset contains data from different city data portals and has more information focused on crime and arrests in big cities. Additionally it contains information regarding housing, education, and poverty levels of different cities. Lastly, we also have access to police employment, policies and budgets per city. This dataset is focused on uncovering demographics and crime statistics of U.S cities.  

## Technical Description

 For this project, we are planning to compile a shiny app for viewers to interact with. There are a few obstacles that we foresee coming up during the data collection process. First, statistics on this topic are constantly updating, so finding accurate data may be difficult. Finding information on police officer outcomes after shootings will also be difficult since that data may not be readily available to the public. Finally, the data sets we have found contain many unknown cells, so it will be hard to accurately categorize these individuals.

 As far as the entire project goes, cleaning the data will be a larger challenge we will encounter. The datasets we will be using contain a lot of information to sort through. We will also have to tell a concise and clear story with the data, which is a new skill that will stretch our critical-thinking. A technical skill that we will specifically work on for this project is data prepping. More specifically, we will have to narrow down and clean our data to contain only relevant variables. We will also have to review how to create interactive data visualizations that are easy for viewers to use.
